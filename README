The IMI Max patches is a collection of Max patches used or made at the design for interaction and moving image course at the London College of Communication (University of the Arts London). 

This light version comes without the media or the plugins folder. To install plugins use the plugins_download patch in the Max Extra menu.

If you have been a student on the course and have the media and the plugins folder installed, the installer will update your patches but won't touch the media / plugins folder.
